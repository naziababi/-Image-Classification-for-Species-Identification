# -Image-Classification-for-Species-Identification
This project employs machine learning methods, notably CNNs, for image segmentation to accurately identify species. Transfer learning with models like VGG19 and EfficientNetB3 enhances classification by adapting pre-trained features. YOLOv5 enables real-time, multi-species detection, improving efficiency in environmental monitoring.
